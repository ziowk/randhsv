Overview:
Outputs terminal escape code for 24bit rgb color to stdout. Color is generated
as hsv with random hue, saturation=0.5, value=0.95 and converted to rgb.

Usage:
Put it as \[$(randhsv)\] in $PS1 in your .bashrc before string which you want to
be colored with randomish color. Don't forget to reset color afterwards.

Requirements:
Your terminal should support 24bit color escape codes (with semicolons). Test
it with:
$ echo -e '\x1b[38;2;166;45;182mPURPLE TEXT\x1b[0m'
You should get purple text. You can also use [1] to be sure.
